TRANSLATION SYSTEM - REMOVED

All translation logic has been removed from the codebase on February 27, 2026.

Removed Components:
- GTranslate library scripts from all pages
- Language selector buttons from navbar and account settings
- Language selection JavaScript handlers
- Language selector CSS styling
- /api/set-language backend endpoint
- Language column migration from database initialization
- Language preference storage in session

Files Cleaned:
- public/index.html
- public/login/index.html
- public/account/index.html
- public/navbar.html
- public/assets/css/pages/page-account.css
- public/assets/js/components/navbar.js
- index.js (backend API)

Notes:
- The database may still have a 'language' column if it was previously migrated
- No translation features are currently available
- All pages now display in English only
